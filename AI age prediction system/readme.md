# 🧠 AI Age Prediction System

Welcome to the AI Age Prediction System project! This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict a person's age based on various features.

## 📋 Project Overview

The AI Age Prediction System is designed to accurately estimate a person's age using a dataset of features such as physical attributes, lifestyle factors, and other relevant data. This project demonstrates the application of regression models in predicting continuous variables.

## 🚀 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for training.
- **Feature Engineering**: Selecting and transforming features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training**: Implementing and training various regression models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Prediction**: Using the trained model to predict ages on new data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for this project.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive development and documentation.
